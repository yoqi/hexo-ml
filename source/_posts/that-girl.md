**There's a girl but I let her get away**

**It's all my fault cause pride got in the way**

And I'd be lying if I said** I was ok**

About that girl the one I let get away

**I keep saying no**

This can't be the way we're supposed to be

I keep saying no

You gotta

There's gotta be a way to get you close to me

Now I know you gotta

Speak up if you want somebody

Can't let them get away, oh no

You don't wanna end up sorry

The way that I'm feeling everyday

\(Don't you know\)

**No no no no**

There's no home for the broken heart

**No no no no**

\(Don't you know\)

There's no home for the broken

There's a girl but I let her get away

**It's my fault cause I said I needed space**

**I've been torturing myself night and day**

About that girl, the one I let get away

**I keep saying no**

This can't be the way it was supposed to be

**I keep saying no**

There's gotta be a way to get you

There's gotta be a way to get you

**Close to me**

Speak up if you want somebody

Can't let him get away, oh no

You don't wanna end up sorry

The way that I'm feeling everyday

\(Don't you know\)

**No no no no**

There's no home for the broken heart

\(Don't you know\)

**No no no no**

There's no home for the broken

**No home for me**

**No home cause I'm broken**

**No room to breathe**

And I got **no one to bla-ame**

**No home for me**

**No home cause I'm broken**

About that girl

The one I let get away

So you better

Speak up if you want somebody

You can't let him get away oh no

You dont wanna end up sorry

The way that I'm feeling everyday

\(Don't you know\)

**No no no no**

There's no home for the broken heart

\(Don't you know\)

**No no no no**

There's no home for the broken

Oh

You don't wanna lose at love

It's only gonna hurt too much

I'm telling you

You don't wanna lose at love

It's only gonna hurt too much

**I'm telling you**

**You don't wanna lose at love**

Cause There's no home for the broken heart

About that girl

The one I let get away
